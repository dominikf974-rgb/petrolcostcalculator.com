      <h2>Legal Notice</h2>

      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        This legal notice applies to the online service at <b>petrolcostcalculator.com</b> including all associated subpages.
        The purpose of this website is to provide information and a free online calculator for approximate calculation of travel costs
        (fuel costs, total costs, cost per person) as well as supplementary reference values (e.g. toll/vignette, CO₂ estimate).
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">1. Content of the Online Service</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        The content of this website is created and maintained with the greatest possible care. Nevertheless, no guarantee can be given for
        accuracy, completeness, timeliness or permanent availability. The provided information does not constitute individual, technical
        or legal advice and does not replace professional consultation.
      </p>

      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        In particular, fuel prices, toll systems, vignette obligations, traffic rules or emission factors may vary by region, time,
        provider, vehicle class and individual circumstances. Use of the information provided is therefore at your own risk.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">2. Calculator Results / Estimates</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        The results of the fuel cost calculator are based on user input and simplified assumptions. They are approximate calculations
        and estimates. Deviations in practice are possible and even likely, as real conditions (e.g. traffic, detours, driving style,
        load, tyre pressure, weather, vehicle condition) have a significant impact on consumption and costs.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">3. Liability for Content</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with general laws. However, we assume
        no liability for material or immaterial damages resulting from the use or non-use of the information provided or from the use of
        incorrect or incomplete information, unless there is proven intentional or grossly negligent fault.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">4. Liability for Links</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        This website may contain links to external third-party websites. We have no influence on their content and therefore cannot assume
        any liability for such external content. The respective provider or operator is always responsible for the content of linked pages.
        At the time of linking, the pages were checked for possible legal violations; no illegal content was recognisable.
      </p>

      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        Permanent monitoring of the content of linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we become aware
        of any legal infringements, such links will be removed immediately.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">5. Copyright</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        The content and works created by the site operator on these pages are subject to copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution
        and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the respective author or creator.

      </p>

      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        Insofar as content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected and such content is
        identified as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please notify us accordingly. Upon becoming
        aware of any legal violations, such content will be removed immediately.

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">6. Technical Availability</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        We endeavour to provide the service with as little interruption as possible. However, downtimes cannot be ruled out despite all due
        care, particularly due to maintenance work, technical faults or events beyond our control (e.g. disruptions at third parties).
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">7. Privacy</h2>
      <p class="small" style="margin-top:0;line-height:1.85">
        Information on the processing of personal data can be found in the <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

      <h2 style="margin-top:16px">8. Contact</h2>

        relevant so that an issue can be reproduced.
