      <h2>What should be included?</h2>
      <p>Most people split fuel only. For longer trips, you may also add:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tolls</li>
        <li>Parking</li>
        <li>Ferries / congestion charges (where relevant)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>First, calculate the fuel cost for the trip:</p>

      <h2>3 practical ways to split fuel costs</h2>

      <h3>1) Simple split (total ÷ people)</h3>
      <p>Best when everyone rides the full trip.</p>

      <h3>2) Distance-based split (per km / per mile)</h3>
      <p>Best when someone joins for only part of the route.</p>
      <p>Tip: using cost per 100km makes this easy:</p>

      <h3>3) Optional driver bonus</h3>
      <p>The driver handles planning, wear, and the actual driving. Some groups reduce the driver’s share or add a small fixed “thank you”.</p>

      <h2>Example: 4-person road trip</h2>
      <p><strong>Trip fuel cost:</strong> 64 (example)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple split: 64 ÷ 4 = <strong>16 each</strong></li>
        <li>Driver bonus (example): driver pays 8, others pay 18.7 each (pick a rule that feels fair)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rules that prevent arguments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Agree what’s included before you start</li>
        <li>Pick one method (simple or distance-based)</li>
        <li>Be transparent: share the calculator result</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Should we split only fuel or also wear and tear?</h3>
      <p>For occasional trips, fuel (+ tolls/parking) is usually enough. For regular carpools, a small per-distance contribution can be fair.</p>

      <h3>How do we split costs if someone rides only part of the way?</h3>
      <p>Use a distance-based split: cost per km × each person’s ride distance.</p>

      <h3>Is a driver bonus fair?</h3>
      <p>It can be—especially for long trips. Agree the rule upfront so it doesn’t feel arbitrary.</p>

      <h3>What’s the fastest way to calculate the trip cost?</h3>
      <p>Use the calculator with distance, consumption, and fuel price, then split the total using your chosen method.</p>
